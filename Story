One bright morning as the Fox was following his sharp nose through the wood in search of a bite to eat,
 he saw a Crow on the limb of a tree overhead.
  This was by no means the first Crow the Fox had ever seen.
   What caught his attention this time and made him stop for a second look,
    was that the lucky Crow held a bit of cheese in her beak.
No need to search any farther," thought sly Master Fox. "Here is a dainty bite for my breakfast."

Up he trotted to the foot of the tree in which the Crow was sitting,
 and looking up admiringly, he cried, "Good-morning, beautiful creature!"
